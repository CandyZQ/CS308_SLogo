## Examining an existing API

They are described as to be very completely documented. Each of the different collections or sub-collections are described with some of their most important methods, different tasks they are useful for, or common issues that could be found when implementing these data structures.

#### In your experience using these collections, are they hard or easy to use?
These are all not that hard to implement and use as they are mostly different types of general data structures. The API is also well documented, which makes understanding very easy. 

#### In your experience using these collections, do you feel mistakes are easy to avoid?

I feel like mistakes can be easily made when using these collections, but they also can be easily fixed. Each of the general collections have their separate parts that work differently or have different functions and can be used for tasks that require new challenges.

#### How many different implementations are there for a specific collection class (such as Set)? Do you think the number justifies it being an interface or not?

For a specific collection class, there are anywhere from 5 to approximately 10 implementations. Given this relatively large number, I think it is appropriate to classify it as an interface so that its various implementations may extend and use its attributes.

#### Why does it make sense to have a utility class?

A utility class, or a class that cannot be instantiated, is stateless and just contains related methods. Most of the time these classes are bad because they broaden the scope of methods and make code public that would otherwise be private. However it can make sense to have a utility class if the methods contained therein are not specific to a given object and can be used by a wide range of objects.
